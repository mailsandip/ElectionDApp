This is a simple dApp, showing the capabilities of OpenUI5 and Blockchain Integration. Its a Election Voting App, and a valid user can vote for a user using the Metamask extension
The Candidate Lists are stored on the Blockchain, and the voting results are also stored. 

A valid ethereum address can vote for one candidate only. 

Once the App is loaded, it shows the option to connect to your Metamask

Once connected to the metamask, the App retrieves the Candidate list from the Blockchain via the Smart Contract function. It also shows the address thru which you have logged in

For a valid vote, it opens the Metamask for Tx confirmation
